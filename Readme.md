# What am I?
I'm a quick and dirty gui wrapper for batch converting audio files.
Bare minimum.

Designed to be turned into an executable using fbs 

## To Build
Generate a venv, install PyQt5, fbs.
Currently fbs isn't working for python 3.7, 3.8.  I have gotten it to work on 3.6.


To generate executable for your OS run:
```(env)> fbs freeze```

To generate installer for your OS run:
```(env)> fbs installer```
